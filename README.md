## Movie Review App (IMDb Clone)

## Developed by EMELU NNAMDI A
## JetThoughts Test Project

This is a movie review project. The home page displays the list of different movies. Users who visit this site will get information about the listed movies. Each movie comes with a video clip that shows the highlight of the movie. Only users who are registered on the site will be allowed to review or rate a movie. Unregistered users who will attempt to see movie details or rate a movie will be directed to the login page.
Registered users can sign in to the app using their email and password. Signed-in users will have the privilege to see each movie's details by clicking on the plus icon at the top left corner of each movie. This icon will open the movie details page. The movie's details page displays the various star rating of that movie by different users as well as the average rating. Information such as movie title, director, description movie-length, category, clip, and thumbnail images are displayed. The user can click on the review button to add his/her review. The movie is listed in a horizontal row. The movie list has a pagination feature that loads six movies in a row. The pagination feature allows users to move front or backward to see more movies. Signed-in users will also see a selection field at the top right corner of the movie list. This will help them to sort the movie according to their categories. If a logged-in user is an admin, the Admin Panel link will also be displayed at the top right corner below the navigation area. The Admin panel is implemented using the rails admin gem. It helps the admin to manage and perform CRUD actions on the app.

## Viewing Page

This project is designed to work on a desktop or large screen at this time. Responsiveness will be implemented in the future time.
